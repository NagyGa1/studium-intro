## Quote Engine
Introduction

---

We believe that insurance product implementations should take days not months.

The <span style="color: #6f7dbc">insurer</span> defines the <span style="color: #6f7dbc">product</span>,
the <span style="color: #6f7dbc">engine</span> presents it in a consistent
manner to its <span style="color: #6f7dbc">target channels</span>: intermediaries, direct clients.

---

The engine sits in front of the existing backend systems of the company.

#### Product lifecycle management

A <span style="color: #6f7dbc">product definition</span> is a self contained entity.

Once it is done, can be saved into a <span style="color: #6f7dbc">text file</span> and <span style="color: #6f7dbc">uploaded</span> to the live
environment, where it is usable <span style="color: #6f7dbc">instantly</span>.

---

##### Product = Structure + Business rules

...and business rules. We have an integrated rules engine
that does the heavy lifting.

#### Client accounts support

Once a client buys a policy, an account is created to her and the link
is sent. The client can <span style="color: #6f7dbc">self-administer</span> policies / claims from there onwards.

---

#### Intermediary accounts self-management

Intermediaries can sign up with their Google, Facebook, LinkedIn identities,
or just by an email address.

Product access can be granted to them by inhouse staff.

---
